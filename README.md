# Java-Assignment1-Part1
This is my Java Assignment it is a tax calculator based on setr tax brackets (Not accurate to current tax ranges). 

Run.bat is used to run the program it will open a CMD line and ask you to input data based on the selections made, this will then return a total income tax result.I have also made it so you can repeat this program without reopning the CMD line for easy testing. 

Tax.Java is my raw code. If you have a look at this any suggestions on my programing are welcome! 

Thanks! 
Brandon.
